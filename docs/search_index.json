You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.

I used SQLite Studio to build my tables and linked them with Primary Keys. You can find that database here. I couldnt figure out how to link the foreign keys, so acknowledge that gap in my database 2.1 This is what my code looked like CREATE TABLE plant_list ( latin_name char(50), common_name varchar(50), PRIMARY KEY (common_name) ); CREATE TABLE functional_traits ( latin_name varchar(50), growth_rate numb(10), root_length numb(10), horizontal_spread numb(10), PRIMARY KEY (growth_rate) ); CREATE TABLE plant_groups ( latin_name varchar(50), wetland_indicator_status varchar(10), life_cycle varchar(50), dormancy_breaking_strategy varchar(50), PRIMARY KEY (wetland_indicator_status) ); CREATE TABLE seed_collection ( plant_id varchar(50), latin_name char(50), collection_site varchar(10), name_collector char(10), date_collected numb(10), PRIMARY KEY (collection_site) ); CREATE TABLE seed_coating ( plant_id varchar(50), coating_type varchar(10), latin_name char(50), plant_date numb(10), PRIMARY KEY (coating_type) ); CREATE TABLE research_plots ( plot_name char(50), plant_id varchar(50), longitude numb(50), latitude numb(50), PRIMARY KEY (plot_name) ); 2.2 This is my schema bold= primary key.
